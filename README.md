# Application Form

ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project is a simple, yet elegantly designed, Application Form built entirely using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. It serves as a foundational example for creating user-friendly web forms with a clean and responsive design.
The aim was to create a straightforward form that is easy to navigate and visually appealing across various devices. It demonstrates best practices for form layout and basic styling, making it a great starting point for anyone looking to build web forms.


FEATURES

* Clean and Intuitive Layout: Designed for ease of use and readability.
* Basic Input Fields: Includes common form elements like text inputs, email, password, and submit button.
* Responsive Design: Adapts gracefully to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones) for an optimal user experience.
* Pure HTML & CSS: No JavaScript or external frameworks are used, showcasing fundamental web development skills.
* Modern Aesthetics: Utilizes modern CSS techniques for a pleasant visual appearance.


TECHNOLOGY USED

This project is built with the core web technologies:
* HTML5: For the semantic structure and content of the application form.
* CSS3: For all the styling, layout, and visual presentation of the form, ensuring a responsive and attractive interface.


USAGE

Once you have opened the index.html file in your browser, you will see the application form. You can interact with the input fields, fill in details, and observe the styling. Since this is a purely front-end project (HTML/CSS only), the form data will not be processed or submitted to a backend. It's designed to demonstrate the visual and structural aspects of a web form.
